A love letter came through the mail, it said, I miss you
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I am tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I am blind
I am confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no b*tch
I admit that I am rich and I am lit
Jumpin up on stages, I get two hundred occasion
Bro had really f*cked the game up, we made n*ggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I am the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
